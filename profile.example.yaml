# Resume Profiles
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Define multiple resume profiles for different types of roles.
# During job search, the AI automatically picks the best resume for each job.
#
# Each profile needs:
#   - name: unique identifier (used internally)
#   - file: filename in ~/.ronin/resumes/ (plain text resume content)
#   - seek_resume_id: UUID from Seek.com.au (set during board setup)
#   - use_when: rules for when this resume should be selected
#
resumes:
  - name: "default"
    file: "default.txt"                      # File in ~/.ronin/resumes/
    seek_resume_id: ""                       # Set during: ronin setup --step boards
    use_when:
      job_types:
        - "full-time"
        - "contract"
      description: "General purpose resume for most applications"

  # Example: add a second resume for contract work
  # - name: "contract"
  #   file: "contract.txt"
  #   seek_resume_id: ""
  #   use_when:
  #     job_types:
  #       - "contract"
  #       - "consulting"
  #     description: "Emphasises relevant experience for contract/consulting roles"

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Cover Letter Configuration
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
cover_letter:
  tone: "casual professional"                # "casual professional", "formal", "conversational"
  max_words: 150
  spelling: "Australian English"             # "Australian English", "American English", "British English"
  example_file: "cover_letter_example.txt"   # In ~/.ronin/assets/
  highlights_file: "highlights.txt"          # In ~/.ronin/assets/

  # Rules for the AI to avoid generic/robotic cover letters
  anti_slop_rules:
    - "Never use: 'passionate about', 'leverage my skills', 'drive value'"
    - "No AI vocabulary: 'Additionally', 'delve', 'enhance', 'fostering'"
    - "No em dashes"
    - "No dramatic reframes: 'That's not failure. That's data.'"

  # How to frame cover letters for different engagement types
  contract_framing: "Problem-first. What's the challenge? You've handled similar before. Emphasise speed to impact."
  fulltime_framing: "Future-oriented. Where are they going? Show you think about systems and processes, not just tasks."
