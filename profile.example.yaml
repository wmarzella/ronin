# Resume Profiles
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Define multiple resume profiles for different hiring signals.
# During job search, the AI automatically picks the best resume for each job.
#
# Each profile needs:

#   - file: filename in ~/.ronin/resumes/ (plain text resume content)
#   - seek_resume_id: UUID from Seek.com.au (set during board setup)
#   - archetype: expansion | consolidation | adaptation | aspiration
#   - hiring_signal: what this resume variant should signal to hiring teams
#   - role_title_patterns: title fragments that should bias selection
#   - keyword_bias: domain keywords that should bias selection
#   - use_when: rules for when this resume should be selected
