EXAMPLE PHILOSOPHY - Your Engineering Philosophy (Optional)
=============================================================

Replace this with your own engineering philosophy or approach.
This file is optional and can be referenced in prompts if you want
your cover letters to reflect your professional values.

Example:
"I believe good engineering is about solving problems simply. The best
system is the one that's easy to understand, easy to change, and does
exactly what it needs to do - nothing more. I'd rather ship something
that works and iterate than architect the perfect solution on paper."
