EXAMPLE PHILOSOPHY - Your Professional Philosophy (Optional)
=============================================================

Replace this with your own professional philosophy or approach.
This file is optional and can be referenced in prompts if you want
your cover letters to reflect your professional values.

Examples:

For an engineer:
"I believe good engineering is about solving problems simply. The best
system is the one that's easy to understand, easy to change, and does
exactly what it needs to do."

For a nurse:
"Patient care isn't just clinical — it's about listening, anticipating
needs, and making people feel heard. The best outcomes come from teams
that communicate clearly and act quickly."

For a project manager:
"Good project management is about removing obstacles, not adding process.
My job is to make sure the team can focus on the work that matters."
