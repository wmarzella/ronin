I've worked on enough data platforms to know what actually matters.

Most fail not from bad tech choices, but from building too much too soon. Teams obsess over tools while the business waits months for a single reliable number. I'd rather ship something useful in week one than architect the perfect lakehouse that never gets queried.

I'm skeptical of complexity. If a problem can be solved with a SQL view, I'm not reaching for Spark. If a cron job works, I'm not setting up Airflow. The right tool is usually the boring one.

I care more about whether data gets used than whether the pipeline is elegant. A dashboard that changes one decision is worth more than a warehouse full of tables nobody touches.

I delete things. Dead code, unused tables, over-engineered abstractions - they all slow teams down. Cleaning up is real work, not a side project.

I'm direct about tradeoffs. If something will take longer than expected, I'll say so early. If a requirement doesn't make sense, I'll push back before building it wrong. I'd rather have an uncomfortable conversation now than a failed project later.

I don't need hand-holding, but I ask questions. Understanding the actual problem matters more than jumping straight to implementation. Sometimes the best engineering is realizing you don't need to build anything.

I'm not precious about my work. If someone has a better idea, I'll use it. If something I built needs to be thrown away, fine. The goal is solving the problem, not protecting my code.
